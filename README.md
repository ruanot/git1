# git1
first git.. test from windows.
Nothing terribly exciting... 
Lots of tools in this editor which need explored.
thats it for now.


So this is an edit of the original readme file which I'm doing in the branch.. 

Now this is a further edit which is required as I didn't include my 'include fixes#1' in the last pull request...
